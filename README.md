# TypeScript Node.js Project

A basic Node.js project setup with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- Alternatively, [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) can be used as a package manager.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (if applicable).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the project dependencies:

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Compiles the TypeScript code from the `src` directory into JavaScript in the `dist` directory.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the compiled JavaScript application (expects `dist/index.js` to be present). This script should typically be run after a successful build.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the TypeScript source code files. The main entry point is typically `src/index.ts`.
- **`dist/`**: Contains the compiled JavaScript output generated by the TypeScript compiler. This directory is usually not committed to version control.
- **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and defines scripts.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., `node_modules/`, `dist/`).
